# SnakeRemastered
Taking the classic game "Snake" and throwing in new features for experimental purposes.

As of 1/7/20, the game is designed for 1 player. The controls use WASD to move, however, if you hold down two directional keys (such as W + A or S + D) you can move diagonally. Just like in standard Snake, the game ends if you collide with yourself or the wall. Future features will be documented as they arrive.

**EXPERIMENTAL** The game increments in speed every 5 points you earn. Reach uncontrollable speeds for a fun experience!
